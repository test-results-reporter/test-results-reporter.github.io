# Teams

Microsoft Teams is a communication platform. To send reports to a teams channel, we need to create a incoming webhook url. Follow this [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook) to create one.

## Arguments

#### > url (string)

Incoming webhook url from slack.

#### > publish (string) _(optional)_

Type of report to be published to the slack channel.

- test-summary _(default)_
- test-summary-slim
- failure-details

#### > only_failures (boolean) _(optional)_

Only include failed test suite or test case details.

> Defaults to **false**

#### > title (string) _(optional)_

Overrides the default title.

#### > title_suffix (string) _(optional)_

Adds a custom suffix to the title.

#### > width (string) _(optional)_

Controls the width of the message.

> Supports `Full` as width.
